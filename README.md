# Advent of Code 2023: Days 1-5

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2023, covering days 1 to 5, implemented in C++.

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Each day brings a new set of challenges, and these solutions provide a way to tackle the problems presented in days 1 to 5.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Day1.cpp`: Solution for day 1 puzzle.
- `Day2.cpp`: Solution for day 2 puzzle.
- `Day3.cpp`: Solution for day 3 puzzle.
- `Day4.cpp`: Solution for day 4 puzzle.
- `Day5.cpp`: Solution for day 5 puzzle.


## Running the Code

To run the code, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile each day's solution using the compiler of your choice. For example, using `g++`:

```bash
g++ -o Day1 Day1.cpp
./Day1
